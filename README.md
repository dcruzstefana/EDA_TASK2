# EDA_TASK2
This project provides a comprehensive Python script for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The script is designed to uncover meaningful insights from structured datasets by summarizing statistics and creating visualizations that highlight key data characteristics. It begins by loading a dataset in CSV format, displaying a preview of the data, and summarizing its structure, types, and missing values. It then computes descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles, offering a quantitative overview of each feature. The analysis includes visualizations such as histograms to observe distributions and boxplots to detect outliers. A correlation matrix with a heatmap is generated to examine feature relationships, and a pairplot is included for a more detailed multivariate exploration. To enhance interactivity and user experience, an interactive scatter matrix using Plotly is also integrated. This provides an intuitive way to explore pairwise relationships, especially when categorical coloring is applied. Categorical features are briefly analyzed by printing unique value counts, helping to identify potential groupings or labels. Outlier detection is performed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, and a count of potential outliers for each numeric column is displayed. These steps collectively support pattern recognition, anomaly detection, and an overall understanding of the datasetâ€™s structure.
